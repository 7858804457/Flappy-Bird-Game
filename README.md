# Flappy-Bird-Game
This is Python Based Project.


🐤 Flappy Bird Game using Python (Pygame)

A simple yet fun Flappy Bird game clone built using Python and Pygame, demonstrating key concepts of Game Development, Physics simulation, OOP (Object-Oriented Programming), Collision Detection, and Scoring Mechanism.

🚀 Features

✔ Built with Python & Pygame
✔ Uses OOP Principles (Bird and Pipe as separate classes)
✔ Realistic gravity, jump, and collision physics
✔ Dynamic pipe generation and scoring system
✔ Keyboard-controlled gameplay (Spacebar to flap)
✔ Clean and beginner-friendly code

📥 Installation
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Flappy-Bird-Python.git
cd Flappy-Bird-Python

2️⃣ Install Required Library
pip install pygame

▶️ How to Run the Game
python flappy_bird.py

🎮 Game Controls
Action	Key
Flap / Jump	Spacebar
Quit	Close Window
📜 Explanation of OOP Usage
Class	Purpose
Bird	Handles bird movement, physics, jumping, drawing
Pipe	Generates top/bottom pipes, updates movement, collision
Game Loop	Updates frame, checks collisions, tracks score

This project demonstrates:

Encapsulation (bird and pipe attributes are managed inside classes)

Object instantiation (multiple pipes)

Collision detection using pygame.Rect

Score counting when bird passes pipes

🧪 Future Enhancements (Ideas!)

🚀 Add background images and bird sprites
🎵 Integrate jump, collision, and game-over sounds
📊 Add Start Menu, Restart option, High Score system
📱 Convert to APK (Android) or EXE (Windows)

💡 Learning Outcomes

By building this game, you learn:

✔ Game development basics
✔ Physics simulation (gravity, velocity)
✔ Object-Oriented Programming in Python
✔ Real-time rendering with Pygame
✔ Handling keyboard events
